## Out for the Count by Martin Downing

{% include play/image.html index=0 width=3 height=4 %}

A mysterious Count, newly arrived from Transylvania, and visiting Dr. Sewer's lunatic asylum in Whitby, attempts to seduce the women of the house, hungry as he is for more than the Bloody Mary offered as a pre-dinner drink.

{% include play/image.html index=1 width=4 height=3 %}

Thwarted by a cross shaped birthmark and hounded by a professor carrying a carpet bag full of crosses he enlists the help of the obnoxious Rennet whose idea of heaven is a black pudding factory.

Fresh out of stakes, the professor and young Jonathan seem to have lost the battle but they, and the Count, had reckoned without Bridget the feisty cook.

## Frankenstein’s Last Chance by Geoff Bamber

{% include play/image.html index=4 width=4 height=3 %}

Set a little later than the original book Doctor Viktor Frankenstein is married to Elizabeth and they have a daughter, Klara, on the verge of marrying another Doctor, Henry Servalle.

{% include play/image.html index=5 width=3 height=4 %}

Unfortunately weddings cost money and Viktor has dropped out of regular doctoring to become a mad scientist -  with limited success!

Henry blows the honeymoon money on tickets to the Mad Scientist's convention and they set about coming up with an entry to win them first prize.
