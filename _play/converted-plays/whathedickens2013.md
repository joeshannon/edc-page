A true Dickensian Christmas with halls decked with boughs of holly.

{% include play/image.html index=1 width=4 height=3 %}

For one evening we brought you everything that Christmas meant to Dickens and the Victorians,  a candle lit tree, jolly hot chestnut sellers, children with rickets, gin soaked harridans,   a mysterious man in an opera cape heading towards Whitechapel and some fruity East End tarts.

The eminent Victorians â€“ Tara Studholme Lyons, Phoebe Guy, Ella James, Jennie Anderson, Roger Mathewson, Doug Thomson, Lewis Hutchins and Alfie Taylor.
