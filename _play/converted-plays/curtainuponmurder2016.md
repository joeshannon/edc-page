An amateur theatre company is rehearsing in the theatre at the end of the pier.

Storms rage overhead and the doors are locked — they are trapped!

Then a mysterious, ghostly presence passes across the stage, and when the Assistant Stage Manager falls to certain death through a trapdoor and the remaining cast start dying one by one it’s a mad dash to find out who doesn’t want the production to go on!
