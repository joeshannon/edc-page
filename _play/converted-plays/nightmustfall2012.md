Danny has already murdered one woman, and there is little doubt that he will soon murder another â€“ the aged owner of a lonely house in a forest in Essex.

{% include play/image.html index=1 width=4 height=3 %}

He gradually insinuates himself into her affections in a skilful manner, for Dan is a dashing young assassin, a completely self-centred psychopath with no feelings and a vast imagination, who is perpetually acting, for his own enjoyment, the part of the murderer.

He taunts the old ladies niece and plays a dangerous game of cat and mouse with everyone including the all knowing Inspector out to catch him.
