Agatha Christie's famous sleuth Miss Marple gets to work in The Murder at the Vicarage. Colonel Protheroe's murder is a shock to all who live at St. Mary Mead, though he wasn't well liked. The vicar, and his young and flirtatious wife, could be considered suspects - the Vicar had said that the death of the Colonel would be a good thing. And Mrs. Protheroe, or her lover, the young artist Lawrence Redding are also under suspicion.
