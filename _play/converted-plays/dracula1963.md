This interpretation of the Bram Stoker novel Dracula by Hamilton Deane and John L Balderstone includes all the Gothic horrors that would be expected - flying bats, howls of dogs, seeping mist and, of course, the Count in his coffin.

Special permission had to be sought for Exeter Drama Company to put on this production, and even had a Red Cross nurse in attendance incase any of the audience suffered from fright.
