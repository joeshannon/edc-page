## Directed by Malcolme Littler

## Was performed 28th March 2013 at The Shed.

For this One Night Stand we take to the high seas with All at Sea, an evening compiled and directed by Malcolme Littler.

{% include play/image.html index=0 width=4 height=3 %}

Come aboard and enjoy an evening of fun and frolics as we delve into all things nautical. We’ll cover the Royal Navy, the gallant Merchant Navy, the RNLI and both the experienced amateur sailor and the complete buffoon.

Lash yourselves to the mast and enjoy our usual mix of fact,nonsense and song (if we can clean up the sea shanties!!) and feast on the ships rations during the interval! Anyone not enjoying themselves can expect to be keel hauled!
