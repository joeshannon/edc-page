In the Tinder Box, by Nicholas Stuart Gray, Peter, a wounded soldier disbanded from the army, is homeless, hungry and alone. Due to the folly of a wicked old witch, a magic tinder box falls into Peter's possession. He realises the tinder box has magical properties. He becomes a very wealthy and generous nobleman, and falls in love with a princess. The king and queen have been told by a fortune teller that their daughter will marry a soldier. They are mortified by this and lock up their daughter. Meanwhile, the witch is desperate to find Peter and retrieve the box, and takes a position as lady-in-waiting to the imprisoned princess. But with the help of his magical friends, Peter manages to combat the witch, win the hand of the princess and bring respectability to the 'common soldier'.
