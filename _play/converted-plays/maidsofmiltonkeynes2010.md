The setting is Georgian England where Prudence gets her thrills from reading gothic novels and Catastrophe is committed to female emancipation.

What hope for either lady as both are in for shock and upset when long lost relations return, initially unwanted suitors are thwarted and shipwrecks and sword fights conspire to keep families and loved ones apart.

A motley collection of Mariners, Monastics, Nobles and commoners alike combine to make this a fast paced comic romp through the Buckinghamshire countryside.
