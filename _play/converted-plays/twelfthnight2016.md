Separated from her twin brother Sebastian in a shipwreck, Viola disguises herself as a boy, calls herself Cesario, and becomes a servant to the Duke Orsino.

He sends her to woo the Countess Olivia on his behalf, but the Countess falls in love with Cesario.

Meanwhile Olivia’s uncle, Sir Toby Belch, gets drunk with his friend Sir Andrew Aguecheek and they play a trick on Malvolio, Olivia’s steward.

Eventually Sebastian turns up and after a bit of confusion, chaos and comedy all is restored.

Set against a 1920’s gangster background and pulsating with the sounds of the era we, once again, put our very own slant on the Bard.
