Murdered to Death is a spoof in the best Agatha Christie tradition, set in the lounge of a country manor house, the action taking place over a weekend.

The characters are what you would expect to find in such a situation - Bunting the butler, an English Colonel with the prerequisite stiff upper lip, a shady French art dealer and his moll, bumbling local inspectors one who has a tendency to malapropisms and a well meaning local sleuth who seems to attract murder.

Will the murderer be unmasked before everyone else has met their doom, or will the audience die laughing first?
