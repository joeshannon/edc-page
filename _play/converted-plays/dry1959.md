Dry Rot, by John Chapman, is set in the lounge of a country hotel, the "Bull and Cow". A crazy but likeable gang of bookies are staying at the hotel which is run by a retired colonel and his wife and daughter.

There are secret rooms, sliding panels, cases of mistaken identity and a little bit of romance - all of which serve to make this a most amusing tale.
