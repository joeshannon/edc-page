The fairy tale favourite, Pinocchio, is the tale of a magical puppeteer whose creation has a life of its own. It is a salutary story showing children that there can be unexpected side effects to lying - but as with all good fairy tales ends happily ever after

Marian Yendell played the Blue Fairy, Michael May was Candlewick, Roy Kitchen and Janet Robinson were the fox and cat, Margaret Cooper played the owl, and Blossom Cooper a poodle.
