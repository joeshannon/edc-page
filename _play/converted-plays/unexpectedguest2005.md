Lost in the fog, Michael Starkwedder stumbles into Richard Warwick’s study to find him dead and Richard’s wife, Laura, standing near him with a gun. Warwick was a detestable brute hated by his entire household, so when Laura confesses to his murder, Starkwedder agrees to give her an alibi.

The police suspect everyone but are puzzled by a set of unidentified fingerprints. They discover that Warwick made a violent enemy of a man called MacGregor who had gone to Canada after Warwick had killed his child.
