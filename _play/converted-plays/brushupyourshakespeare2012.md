## Directed by Ian Guy

## Performed 21st December 2012 at The Shed.

Another One Night Stand, in which we take on the Bard of Avon himself with Brush up your Shakespeare an evening compiled and directed by Ian Guy (with a little help from Mr Shakespeare!).

All the World’s a stage someone once said and, on our little bit of it, we performed extracts from the plays, gave some interesting facts, all with the usual mix of music and merriment.

Including a rendition of Hamlet by Tom Stoppard that had to be seen to be believed – as it’s accomplished in fifteen minutes flat!
