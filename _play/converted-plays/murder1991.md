In this play by Sam Bate, two nurses, Iver and Boone, inherit £100,000 - left to them after years of looking after old Mrs Deeming. Everyone had expected they would only be getting £500 - it appears that something sinister is going on.

When the lawyer of the deceased asks Nurse Boone for a signature, he is later shot dead. But it could have been his wife who shot him, as she had just discovered him kissing his secretary. Helped by servant Flora, Superintendent Forrest sifts the clues.
