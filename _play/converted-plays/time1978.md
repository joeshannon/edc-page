Time For Fig Leaves' by Duncan Greenwood and Robert King is set in the near future. All the men in the world have died in an atomic accident, and so the world is run by women. But then two men are found alive and brought to the country house of the Prime Minister, who sees them as an opportunity to remain in power. The men have other ideas, and escape.
