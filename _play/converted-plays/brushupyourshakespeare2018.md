All the World’s a stage someone once said and, on our little bit of it, we performed extracts from the plays, gave some interesting facts, all with the usual mix of music and merriment.

Including a rendition of Hamlet by Tom Stoppard that had to be seen to be believed –  it’s accomplished in fifteen minutes flat!
