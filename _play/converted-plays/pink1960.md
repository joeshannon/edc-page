Pink String and Sealing Wax, by Roland Pertwee, is set in the sitting room of the Strachan's house in Brighton during the late 1800's. Edward Strachan is a hard, cold man who controls his family with little tenderness and understanding.

His loving and ambitious children are pushed to the limits by his lack of attentiveness. When his eldest son becomes associated with a married woman who plots to incriminate him in the murder of her husband, Edward realises how wrong his priorities were and tries to protect his son and become reunited with his estranged family.
