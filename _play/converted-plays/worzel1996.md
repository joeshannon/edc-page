Brought to life by the Crowman, the naughty yet lovable Worzel creates havoc and farce wherever he goes in his efforts to win Aunt Sally's unwilling hand. Eventually he finds himself before the scarecrow court on a very serious charge.

The final resolution is a happy one with a birthday cake enormous enough to satisfy even Worzel's appetite!
