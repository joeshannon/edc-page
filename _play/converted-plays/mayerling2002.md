The Mayerling Affair, written by R F Delderfield, is about a doomed royal romance, set in a lavish palace. The heir to the throne, married to a woman he now despises, is desperate to be free of her to marry the woman he loves.

The Monarch, who refuses to accept the existence of the mistress, demands that duty to the throne be paramount. There are the friends and the servants of both parties acting as go-betweens in a dangerous game that could easily become treason and treachery and there is the press who know that something is afoot behind the stern veneer of the palace.

This may all sound rather familiar, but this Royal Family are not the Windsor's, they are the Hapsburg's, for this is Austria in 1888, and leading to a chain of events that will lead only to misery, despair and death.
