I'll Get My Man, by Philip King, is set in a Vicarage in the village of Stebbington- Fawley.

{% include play/image.html index=0 width=4 height=3 %}

Arthur Humphrey is a mild mannered Vicar who decides to advertise for a wife to escape his domineering sister. Unfortunately he forgets to use the word "marriage" in the advert, and he ends up with sack-loads of replies.

To add to the confusion, his nephew, a famous television hero, descends on the Vicarage to seek refuge. To cap it all, the dignified Bishop of Lax decides to visit.
