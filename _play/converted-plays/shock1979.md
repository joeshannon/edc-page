Shock Tactics is a farce by John Dole. A home-built computer called Fred sits in the living room uttering loud and embarrassing remarks at inopportune moments. However, he can be very useful, as he is able to forecast the weather with complete accuracy. When the Met. Office hears of this, they send a spy to infiltrate the household. Although Uncle Ben is far more interested to see whether Fred can predict the winner of the 3.30.

Produced by Joy Hancocks
