Jacks reign of terror has begun and a totally inept British Lord, Sir Charles Warren, has been appointed Commissioner of Police to apprehend him.

Jack, it seems, practices black magic, which requires murderous sacrifices to assure him additional years of life. Four women are murdered, and the play revolves around the attempts to save the fifth — Angela Ellison, a “reformed girl of the streets,” who is the last required to complete Jack’s evil ritual.

A motley crew of characters including the White Witch Pegeen, a hen pecked Physician, Forbes Winslow, a battleaxe of a Suffragette, Ernestine Pankhurst, and trusty manservant Phillip Poole are amongst those who try to outwit Jack’s dastardly plans!

Jack’s identity is not revealed until the end of the play and, as the author has cleverly written three alternative endings, each performance night had a different ending!
