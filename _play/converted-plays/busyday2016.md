A Busy Day is a comic love story set in London in the summer of 1800.

{% include play/image.html index=1 width=4 height=3 %}

In the course of just one busy day we are gleefully tumbled into a world of frustrated love, mistaken identity, snobbery and downright vulgar bad manners.

{% include play/image.html index=2 width=4 height=3 %}

The cast of colourful characters endure an overturned carriage, a scare in Kensington Gardens and a toe curlingly awkward reception in the evening before wrongs are righted, estates are saved and love conquers all!
