The Little Photographer is written by Derek Hoddinott and is based on a short story by Daphne du Maurier.

{% include play/image.html index=0 width=4 height=3 %}

Spending a holiday with her family in a luxury hotel during a heat wave, Marie finds life with her conservative, passionless husband suffocatingly repressive. He is unexpectedly called away on business and, inspired by hints dropped by her easy going friend Elise, Marie starts an affair with a local photographer.

The brief infatuation unleashes events and emotions on a scale undreamt of by Marie and, with a thunderstorm threatening, the curtain comes down on a family whose place in society is now far from certain.

Set in the early 1900's this drama, with its many twists and turns, shows that the path of true love never runs smoothly and is indeed rockier than many of us would imagine.
