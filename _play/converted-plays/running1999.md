Up and Running, by Derek Benfield, is set in the flat of veteran TV host Patrick Sumner. Patrick is trying to prepare for an important meeting with his boss, but his friend Trevor is having girlfriend troubles, and they keep turning up at Patrick's flat. One of them, Jenny, seems intent on passing herself off as Patrick's wife, and when Patrick's real wife turns up unexpectedly the subterfuge begins.
