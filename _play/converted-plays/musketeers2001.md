The play is set in 1625 and the action of the play is based in various locations in France, before the action moves to the residence of the Duke of Buckingham in England. All three of the musketeers separately challenge D'Artagnan to a duel.

He survives these initial encounters to become a valiant ally in their gallant exploits. The foursome's efforts to defend the honour of the queen and the peace of the realm become imperilled when D'Artagnan falls in love with his landlord's daughter, a spy. Also, one of the Musketeer's has a secret which becomes known, and this threatens both the throne and the swordsman's seemingly unbreakable bond.
