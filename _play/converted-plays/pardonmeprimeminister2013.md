With the Prime Minister and Chancellor about to deliver stringent government reforms in the budget the last thing they want is opposition from an unexpected quarter.

{% include play/image.html index=1 width=4 height=3 %}

When the PM discovers that a former ‘indiscretion’ has come back to haunt him he soon has the media sensing a good story, his wife after his blood, the Chancellor after his job and a beleaguered civil servant trying to keep order.

With scantily clad women, confusions over paternity and a delicious twist at the end the goings on in Downing Street will match anything that the real politicians throw at us.
