This version of the fairy tale Snow White, was written by members of our own company.

{% include play/image.html index=0 width=4 height=3 %}

It follows the classic tale of a beautiful young maiden cast into a deep sleep by her evil step-mother, later rescued from the magic spell by the love of handsome Prince Charming.

Our version does differ from the original though; with an extra dwarf who is as camp as a row of tents!
