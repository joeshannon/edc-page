Murder Mistaken, by Jane Green, is a tense thriller set in the 1950's. Outwardly respectable, Edward Bare is, in fact, a cold calculating psychopath. He marries a wealthy widow, Monica, then kills her for her money. However, Monica left the majority of her money to her sister. Edward continues to plot and scheme to get the money, but his past comes back to haunt him.
