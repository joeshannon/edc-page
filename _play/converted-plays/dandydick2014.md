Dandy Dick tells the hilarious story of the Very Reverend Augustin Jedd, a pillar of Victorian respectability, who preaches regularly against the evils of the Turf.

But a visit from his tearaway sister, herself an habitual gambler, leads him to risk all at the races, much against his better judgement.

Mayhem ensues, with romantic intrigue, mistaken identity and runaway horses!
