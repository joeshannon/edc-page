Mr Disney has nothing on the original stories and you’ll be amazed at how bloody and dark they are.

However, it’s not all bad, we have bunged in the usual funny stuff and a bit of jiggery pokery as well....

And maybe you should avoid the bright red apples we’ll be offering during the interval as there aren’t that many handsome princes in Alphington. Allegedly!

Cast:
Alice Purcell, Ella James, Charlotte Guy, Doug Thomson, James Letten, Jahgo Williams, Jordan Bright, Roger Mathewson and Joe Shannon.
