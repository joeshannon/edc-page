Having endured 3 wives already Henry VIII has sworn off marriage for good whereas his courtiers see the 'vacancy' as an opportunity for a political alliance.

Eventually picking the courts choice of Anne of Cleves from paintings provided by Holbein the poor girl turns out to be nothing like Henry expected.

She speaks no English, he speaks no Flemish and on the wedding night the poor interpreter ends up in the marriage bed with them where a hilarious three way conversation takes place!

Grim ladies in waiting, interfering courtiers and a coquettish Katherine Howard all add to the chaos in this Tudor mix of Carry on Henry meets saucy seaside postcards!
