In the Lovecraft room of "Usher", his great country house, ageing horror star Romney Marsh has gathered together a group of theatre people for a read through of his new play.

When the last of his guests has arrived, however, Romney instructs the gatehouse keeper to let loose the Dobermans into the grounds and with a moat full of piranha fish he is confident that his visitors are caught like rats in a trap.

It seems that someone has been sending him old press cuttings relating to the suicide of an old flame thirty years ago and Romney is determined to discover who is raking up the past.

Before too long one of his guests has her throat cut and then there is a poisoning and, with thick fog settling, the remaining ‘luvvies’ all admit to some connection with the dead actress of all those years ago.

With a rising body count the surviving guests hurl accusations about left, right and centre in their frantic and desperate attempts to unmask the killer in their midst.
