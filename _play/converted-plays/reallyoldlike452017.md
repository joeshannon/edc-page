Set some time in the near future, there are too many old people, too many young people and not enough in the middle to look after them all.

Really Old, Like Forty Five is a comically honest look at aging through the plans of a government department tasked with finding solutions and one multi-generational family, coping with the realities of everyday living.

Tamsin Oglesby’s furious comedy, first performed at the National Theatre in 2010, will make you laugh and make you think.
