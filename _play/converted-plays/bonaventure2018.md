A flood in the fen country has forced two prison officers and their prisoner, Sarat Carn, who is on her way to the gallows for the murder of her brother, to take shelter in the convent hospital of Our Lady of Rhiems near Norwich.

Amongst the nursing sisters is Mary Bonaventure, a woman of great understanding and sympathy, who is convinced the girl is innocent even though her appeal has been dismissed.

She turns detective in her effort to establish justice, feeling that her own faith is bound up with the results in a race against time before the flood waters recede and the fateful journey to Norwich prison can continue.
