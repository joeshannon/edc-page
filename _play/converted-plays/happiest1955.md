The war time farce, The Happiest Days of your Life by John Dighton, centers around Hilary Hall School for Boys.

{% include play/image.html index=0 width=4 height=3 %}

The school is very conservative and does not accept change easily. When another school has to leave its premises having been bombed out, the staff reluctantly accept playing host. But when, thanks to a ministry blunder, the visitors turn out to be from the formidable St Swithun's School for Girls, it's hardly surprising that things don't go too smoothly.
