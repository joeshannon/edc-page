Blithe Spirit, by Noel Coward, concerns Charles Condomine whose first wife, Elvira, returns from the dead and tries to stop his relationship with his new wife. Ironically it is his new wife she inadvertently kills, and she then joins Elvira on the "other side".

This production was the first that Exeter Drama Company performed at Stepcote Hill. It was described by a reviewer in the Express and Echo:To "The Steps Theatre" of Exeter last night - and what an intriguing night it was. Follow the rough and ancient Stepcote Hill which runs alongside the church of St Mary Steps, to the church hall, now so ingeniously transformed to the headquarters of Exeter Drama Company."
