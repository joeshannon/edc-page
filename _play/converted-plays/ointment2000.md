A fly in the Ointment, written by Derek Benfield, is set in a bungalow on the Sussex coast.

The bungalow belongs to Donna, the ex-mistress of Ron Corley MP, Minister for the Environment. While he is searching the bungalow, his virtuous wife Louise arrives on the same day at the same place.

Add to these a romantic doctor who is also in Sussex when his practice is in London, a frustrated policewoman and a devious pizza delivery boy and the plot thickens!
