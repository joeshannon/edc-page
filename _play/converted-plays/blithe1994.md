Charles is an author, and as research for his new book he invites Madame Arcarti, a local medium, to conduct a seance at his home. Elvira, his first wife, returns from death, and she is visible and audible only to Charles, and makes life uncomfortable for him.

To try to get Charles to herself, Elvira tampers with the car in an effort to kill him. Ironically it is Ruth who drives the car and so is she who joins Elvira on the "other side. "Charles is now haunted by two jealous spirits and asks Madame Arcarti to try and exorcize them, but it doesn't work. Eventually Charles bids his two ex wives farewell and leaves them tearing the house apart.
