Sam & Fay Spencer think they are about to have a peaceful and relaxing holiday in the luxurious (and free!) Spanish Villa of Fay's boss Sidney....but just how wrong can they be?

The villa has been double booked, the actor Howard Booth and his girlfriend Dodie arriving shortly after the Spencer's, and, to compound the confusion, Sam and Howard have matching holdalls which have become muddled with each other and with a third, full of money, the hunt for which brings the sinister Raynor to the villa.

The assumed identities, breakneck pace and hilarious mishaps of farce mix with the tension, mystery and startling plot reversals in this clever and amusing play.
