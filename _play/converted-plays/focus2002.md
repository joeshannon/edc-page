Out of Focus is by Peter Gordon, and directed by Wendy Montgomery for Exeter Drama Company.

Cleverly crafted and stunningly funny, Out of Focus is set in the annexe of a church hall where the dizzy vicar's wife has multiple booked the brownies, a badminton match, a table tennis match, auditions for the pantomime and a talk on steam locomotives.

Confusion reigns until everyone finally unites for a common cause: the production of the pantomime.

Over the following weeks the cast battle against the odds as the opening night looms and, as alliances have been formed, broken and re-formed, the finale sees that everyone gets their just deserts.
