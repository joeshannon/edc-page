Victor Frankenstein, is a brilliant young scientist, who has returned to his Swiss chateau to escape a terrible pursuer. He will tell no-one the dark secret that terrifies him: not his mother, his fiancée, nor his best friend.

All pleading falls on deaf ears, for Victor has brought into being an unimaginable creature made from pieces of the dead. The creature tracks Victor to his sanctuary, demanding a bride to relieve his loneliness.
