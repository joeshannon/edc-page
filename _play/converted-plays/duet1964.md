## TODO find out which year this was 1964 (play index) or 1973 (on page) 

Duet for Two Hands, by Mary Hayley Bell, is set in the Orkney island home of an eminent surgeon - a hard drinking, egotistical man with a hidden secret.

Unfortunatey we do not have a cast list for this production, but thanks to a review in the Express and Echo we know Alan Finnimore played the surgeon, Andrew Mitchell his masterpiece, Carol Cooper his maid, Joan Richardson was the maiden Aunt and Peggy Seville the dour housekeeper.
