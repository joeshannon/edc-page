Leon Winter always spices up his dinner parties with a practical joke or two, so when the electricity cuts out and a mysterious voice booms from the darkness the guests on this particular night do not think the worst.

Then shots ring out and the joke turns into a nightmare bringing in the eccentric Chief Inspector Plum to investigate a case involving marital deception and twisted quotations from Shakespeare that culminates in a brilliant coup de theatre.
