## Directed by Ric Hutton

## Was performed 19th - 23rd June 2012 at The Shed.

When young Tracey discovers she is pregnant she doesnâ€™t know how to tell either of her parents - solid, dependable Elsie and hypochondriac Idris - or her boyfriend, Bobby.

Gran, permanently bedridden, knows all and sees all, and helps to pave the way for her announcement.

Unfortunately, Idris, overhearing Tracey and Elsie, jumps to the wrong conclusion with hilarious consequences.
