We present to you our first ever musical! Based on the book by Burt Shevelove and Larry Gelbart with music and Lyrics by Stephen Sondheim.

Pseudolus is the laziest slave in Rome and has but one wish, to purchase her freedom. When her master and mistress leave for the day she finds out that young Hero has fallen in love with a virgin in the house of Lycus, a slave dealer specializing in beautiful women.

Pseudolus concocts a deal in which she will be freed if she can procure the girl for Hero. Of course, it can't be that simple as the virgin has already been ‘put aside’ for General Gloriosus! Add into the plot and old man in search of his missing children, characters disguising themselves as one another, numerous catchy songs and a deranged chorus of courtesans, soldiers, eunuchs and citizens and you’ll find it hard not to image yourself back in Rome!
