Robert and Stella are horrified to learn that their young son has been kidnapped - not for ransom, as they are informed by the crook who visits them, but to force them to allow him to remain in their house for forty-eight hours.

After the on-stage murder of the first crook they themselves demand to be treated as house guests and from then on twist follows twist until the highly exciting and ingenious denouement. She is on the run from the Police and also one of Henry's patients, the Police, chasing Rosita, Paul the boyfriend of younger sister Sarah, Henry's fiance the Hon Pamela Colefax and Mrs D'Arcy their redoubtable housekeeper who's fretting about her impending plastic surgery!
