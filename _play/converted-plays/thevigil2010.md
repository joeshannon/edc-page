The Vigil is a tense courtroom drama drama based on the Easter story as, in the dock, stands a Gardener accused of stealing the body of Jesus of Nazareth.

Witnesses called include Pontius Pilate, Mary Magdalene and the soldier who guarded the tomb. As each give their evidence using humour, science or religious conviction you’ll imagine yourself in a real courtroom.

Watch the story unfold as Counsels for Prosecution and Defence do battle to gain the agreement of the Jury and win the day. This is a compelling drama that even Kavanagh QC would be proud of.
