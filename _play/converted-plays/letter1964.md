A Letter from the General, by Maurice McLoughlin, is set in a mission in the Far East, and is a story of gentle nuns under tyranny.

According to an article in the local newspaper about this production:"All the women in this play are housewives and its nice to be able to replace the kitchen sink and apron for a Nun's habit". (Thank goodness times have changed!) Apparently this was the first set in Exeter Drama Company's history with a complete roof - thanks to set designer Averil Alford.
