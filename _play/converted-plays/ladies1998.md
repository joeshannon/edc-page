Her companion is Ellen Creed who now lives in poverty because she is fulfilling a promise to her father to take care of her two dotty sisters, Emily and Louisa. Ellen arrived with her sisters to Leonora's house for a "visit" that has stretched to four months. Leonora demands that they go back to London. Ellen knows her sisters cannot bear to return to the place they hate, so does what she has to do to prevent this.
