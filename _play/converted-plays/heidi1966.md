Heidi, by Beryl M Jones, is the classic tale of an orphan Swiss girl, based on the famous book. A young orphan is sent to live with her grumpy grandfather in the Swiss Alps.

Heidi almost loses her liberty as she is ripped away from the tranquility of the mountains to tend to a sick cousin in the city. Happily, all's well that ends well.

Our version at Stepcote not only included a real goat (pictured) but also a tortoise - guaranteed to make an audience go ahhhhh! Unfortunately we do not have a cast list of this production. However, thanks to a review in the Express and Echo we know Mariln Smith played Heidi. Malcolm Kirby played the young goat herd, Blossom Cooper the invalid child. Sandra Snow, Ian Hancock, Jeremy Mitchell and Janet Robinson made their debuts. Others in the cast included Robert Lapworth, Olive Smith, Roy Kitchen, Marion Yendell, June Godwin, Elanor Lavelle, Ray White and Douglas Berry.
