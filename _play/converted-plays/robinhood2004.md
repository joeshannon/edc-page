This version of Robin Hood is a vivid performance of  action packed drama retelling the famous legend indulging in,

and making fun of, the stilted dialogue found in tiresome historical novels and adventure films.

Here you will find larger than life characters, both good and bad that challenge and reinvent the myths and ballads. You'll meet a scheming Dowager Queen of England, a psychotic mercenary, 'jolly hockey sticks' outlaws and a wise cracking Maid Marian who is arguably a better swordsperson than any of Robin's merry men!

A scary Guy of Gisbourne, complete in horse skin,  is brought in by the Sherriff of Nottingham to help him win over Robin Hood's band, but Robin thwarts the attempt, and with swirling mists, frantic sword fights, murder most foul and more than a few laughs this is truly a story for all ages.
