{% include play/image.html index=0 width=4 height=3 %}

In this version, adapted by Tim Kelly, a cast of wondrous and colourful characters greet Alice when she follows a white rabbit down a hole in the ground.

We followed her adventures as she met the Duchess, the March Hare, nice and not so nice White and Red Kings and Queens and were present at the trial of the Knave.

Dodo’s, caterpillars, playing cards, twins, cats, dormice and, of course, a very Mad Hatter create both magic and mystery!
