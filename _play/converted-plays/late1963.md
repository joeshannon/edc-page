In The Late Edwina Black by William Dinner & William Morum, Edwina Black is a sadistic, nasty woman who rules her household with cruel force. Her companion, Elizabeth, and her husband Gregory, suffer from her temperamental moods. However, Elizabeth does not leave as she has affection for Gregory. Ellen, the housekeeper is a malicious gossip who is devoted to Edwina, and as often as she can she insinuates that Gregory and Elizabeth are having an affair. Then suddenly Edwina dies and the post mortem shows she was poisoned with arsenic.
