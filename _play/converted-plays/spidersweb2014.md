Clarissa, the second wife of Henry Hailsham-Brown, is adept at spinning tales of adventure for the delectation of their bored diplomatic circle, but when a murder takes place in her own drawing room, she finds live drama much harder to cope with. Especially as she suspects that the murderer might be her young stepdaughter, Pippa.

Moreover, Henry will shortly be arriving home with a V.I.P. in tow who might take a dim view of bodies in the drawing room! Clarissaâ€™s fast talking only gets her and Pippa into some hair-raising experiences.

However, by the time Henry gets home the murderer has been unmasked and all is normal, so normal that Henry is utterly unable to believe Clarissa when she explains exactly why there are no refreshments ready for their honoured guest.
