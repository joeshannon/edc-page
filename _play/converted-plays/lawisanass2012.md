## Directed by Ian Guy

## Was performed 28th June 2012 at The Shed.

We tackle all things legal with our One Night Stand, The Law is an Ass.

Weâ€™ll be offering up, as evidence, the usual suspects of poems, startling true facts, a sketch or two and some truly groan worthy funnies.

Hopefully it will prove to be an arresting evening for all!
