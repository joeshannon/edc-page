Brigadier Rayne doesn't have much financial success from his charity concerns until Nan is passed a mink coat by a crook on the run. Soon they are running a well organised receiving system for stolen furs, giving all their profits to charity. Eventually, with the house full of furs and a police inspector making inquiries, they decide its time to retire - temporarily.
