It is Christmas 1183 and Henry II has summoned his sons Richard, Geoffrey &John to join him and his scheming but imprisoned wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine to Chinon Castle where he hopes to name his successor.

Also present are his mistress, Princess Alais, and her crafty brother King Philip of France.

Each of the sons has some flaws that make the decision difficult but with Henry and Eleanor having spent their lives fighting for position and with the fate of Henry's empire at stake, everybody engages in their own brand of deception and treachery to stake their claim. This is going to be a very lively Yuletide!
