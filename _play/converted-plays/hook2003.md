Harold Spooks has been sprung from prison to tell the gang where in the country hotel they've taken him to he has stashed the loot.

Unfortunately, Harold is a bit of a twit who is likely to give the game away at any moment so Charlie and Fred, who have meticulously planned this operation, have endless difficulties organizing rooms and trying to convince the rest of the hotel that they're really there for the fishing!

Add to their problems Norah, the man-eating manageress, Edna, continually interrupting their frenzied plotting and the redoubtable Mrs Fletcher-Brewerand you have a fast moving, hysterical farce that will leave you in stitches!
