The Imperial Nightingale, by Nicholas Stuart Gray, is set in China in the year 200AD

At the lake behind the Imperial Palace a nightingale sings his enchanting song to a humble fisherman and a lowly kitchen maid but once the bird is heard by members of the Imperial Court the Emperor himself commands an audience.

Intrigue follows villainy, dreadful tortures are threatened and a mechanical bird is produced to rival the singing of the real bird but all ends happily when a mysterious Princess hold court at the dead of night!

Truly a captivating story for all the family.
