In this farce by Derek Benfield, Chester Dreadnaught returns from his honeymoon to find his aristocratic in-laws have turned their stately home, Elrood Castle, into a tourist attraction. With the scatty Lord and Lady Elrood opening the castle to the public all sorts of things go wrong. Boy Scouts are camping in the grounds and the gawping visitors are given guided tours by the castle historian Miss Partridge.
