This version of the favourite pantomime Cinderella was written and produced by a member of our own company.

Cinderella is prevented from going to the Ball by her ugly step-sisters. However, her fairy godmother helps her, and she meets the handsome Prince Charmimg who moves heaven and earth (well, he uses a glass slipper) to find her again.
