The Washtub Farce is a comical warning to nagging wives and bullying Mothers in law, in the moving drama. A Well Remembered Voice is about the unexpected result of a war time séance and with Regency Romance its laugh out loud at the antics of Ed, Sandy and Mary as they re-write and role play their own "trashy romantic paperback".

The evening’s sketches cover a bedtime story with a difference, drive a waiter to distraction in a café, and have two nervous girls waiting for an interview and the aftermath of a robbery. The monologues are set on a train and outside a Bingo Hall.
