A Christmas Cracker was an evening in three parts - two plays and a sketch, poems and readings.

## The Monkey's Paw

A scary story about a monkey's paw with magical powers. It gives three wishes to its owners, and rips apart their lives.

## The Hunting Horn

The Hunting Horn, written and directed by Ed Heeley, is set in the ninteenth century and is a ghostly tale about preserving tradition and the relationship between town and country - themes which are resonant today.
