The Prentices are not an ordinary couple by any means. Dr Prentice is a psychiatrist with his own hospital who believes that the best way to interview a girl for a job is to seduce her.

Geraldine does her best to comply, but nothing is going to work smoothly in this hospital. Mrs Prentice, who has seduced a page boy in a hotel, brings him home with her, just at the moment when a state inspector decides to pay a visit.

What ensues is a mild melee of disappearances, disguises and discoveries  as husband and wife try to hide their prizes from one another and the state inspector.Even a wound up policeman gets giddy from the goings-on!
