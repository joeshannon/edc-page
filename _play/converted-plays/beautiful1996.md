Beautiful for Ever, by Glyn Jones, is a story closely based on fact. Madame Rachel has outlived three husbands and in the past was very poor.

She has now found a lucrative occupation making good use of the knowledge she got from one of her husbands who was a chemists assistant. She, helped by her daughter Leonte, makes up useless potions and elixirs, calls them romantic names, and sells them to women to remain 'beautiful for ever'.

The weak, simpering Mrs Borradaile looks like a prize victim, and Madame uses all her ability to defraud her, causing her to become penniless and causing her to be imprisoned for debt. But at eventually she overreaches herself and in the conclusion of the play there is retribution for Madame.
