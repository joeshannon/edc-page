In Leslie Sands' seaside caper set in the Seaview Guest House, the tyrannical landlady Mrs Austin terrorises her lodgers with her bread and butter pudding. The newly-weds Mr and Mrs Pepper realise that marriage is no honeymoon, and Wilf and Ethel Pearson try to prevent their daughter from running off with a local prankster.
