In Tons of Money, by Will Evans and Valentine, an unsuccessful inventor, Aubrey Allington , inherits the life interest in a fortune. On his death it reverts to his cousin George. George is thought to have died abroad, so Aubrey's wife, has the brilliant idea of Aubrey "dying" so that he can be resurrected as his cousin and thus avoid payment of his own enormous debts.But in the best tradition of farce, complications arise in the form of George's wife...

This production was the first that Exeter Drama Company performed at Stepcote Hill. It was described by a reviewer in the Express and Echo: To "The Steps Theatre" of Exeter last night - and what an intriguing night it was. Follow the rough and ancient Stepcote Hill which runs alongside the church of St Mary Steps, to the church hall, now so ingeniously transformed to the headquarters of Exeter Drama Company."
