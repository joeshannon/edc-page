Written and directed by Terence Dale, Hansel and Grethel with Attitude was an addition to our usual winter schedule.

In this version, suitable for adults rather than children, when Woody's wife aided by the rather strange Dr Rubberbottom sends the children into the woods, they are met by not only the Wicked Witch but also two elves who have been doing more with the magic mushrooms in the forest than sit on them, and are more interested in a couple of fairies than the plight of Hansel and Grethel.

However, as in all the best fairy tales, it all ends happily ever after.
