At Shottover Park it’s the eve of the glorious twelfth and Sir Edwin is preparing for the first shoot of the season.  With a house full of guests and staff, all with a secret, and all finding an excuse to visit the gun room there’s bound to be trouble!

When a shot is heard and a body is found is it murder or suicide? And is the death linked in any way to the person attempting to make off with the family tiara? Will Sir Edwin’s’ memoirs reveal more about the family than some would like and what is the film companies real interest in the house?

Inspector Wilby certainly has his work cut out for him.

Written and directed by our own Roger Mathewson, this was our last production at our theatre on Stepcote Hill.
