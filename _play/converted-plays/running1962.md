In Running Riot, a farce by Derek Benfield, Humphrey Podmore is mistaken for a British champion runner at the Olympic Games. When the real champion turns up a man locks him in a cellar as he has placed a bet believing that Humphrey will represent England - needless to say he walks away with the race. Unfortunately we do not have a cast list for this production but thanks to a review in the Express and Echo we know Andrew Mitchell played the hotel proprietor, James Montgomery was Basil, Cynthia Vodden played Nicolette, Stephen Mitchell played Humphrey Podmore, Wendy Burgoyne was Pauline and Phyllis Bolt played Mrs Podmore. Jennifer Clapp was Miss Hacket and John Morris was the slightly sinister Bruchick.
