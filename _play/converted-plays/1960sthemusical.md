## Compiled and Directed by Brian Lawless

## Friday 6th July

## Alphington Village Hall


They say that if you can remember the 60's then you weren't really there so let us help refresh your memories with that big World Cup Win (Hurrah!), the big freeze, Dr Beeching, the Great Train Robbery, The Kray twins, Lady Chatterley and her, um, friend, Christine Keeler and John Profumo and, of course, the brilliant and varied music of the decade.

Bung some flowers in your hair, fish out that kaftan and let the nostalgia wash over you.

The psychedelic hipsters were: *Ed Heeley, Meg Henkus, Brian Lawless, Malcolme Littler, Di Phillips, Tara Studholme Lyons, Robin Thwaytes and Eliot Vosper*
