Set entirely in Marlborough House, the home of Queen Mary,

{% include play/image.html index=1 width=4 height=3 %}

the play focuses on the private family drama of Edward VIII and the Royal Family leading up to the abdication crisis of December 1936.

This powerful drama is both fascinating and moving and, when you strip away the palaces, crowns and titles, is nothing more than a family tearing itself to pieces as it struggles with love, honour and duty.

*Diana Phillips won Best Actress for her part as Queen Mary in our in house awards 2014 - 2015.*
