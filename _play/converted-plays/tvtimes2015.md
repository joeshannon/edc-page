Our very own Christmas Special with TV Times -

{% include play/image.html index=0 width=4 height=3 %}

“What’s on the box” or “repeats again” or “why are we watching this rubbish”? Comments frequently heard in homes all over the land during the TV festive season. Well, now they are repeated again in our show!

{% include play/image.html index=1 width=4 height=3 %}

Robin and his team of high up and over paid executives have put together our usual mayhem and madness for a one off, never to be repeated evening of Christmas cheer as we chart the dominance of the gogglebox. There’s no ‘off’ button – you have to stay until the final credits roll!
