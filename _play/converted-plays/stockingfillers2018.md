## Cinderella

## by Michael Green

## directed by Denise Gough

{% include play/image_1by2.html index=5 width=3 height=4 %}

This is the traditional pantomime (oh, no it isn't, oh, yes it is). A tale of rags to riches, ugly sisters, a flying fairy, a ball and a glass slipper (if we can work out how to make one). What can possibly go wrong?
