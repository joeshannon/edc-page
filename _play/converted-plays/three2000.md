An evening of one act plays on various themes.

## Trifles

Trifles, by Susan Glaspell, is set in a rural community in turn-of-the century Iowa. A farmer's bedroom is being searched by men for evidence of the identity of his murderer; meanwhile, downstairs in the kitchen, two women choose to hide the evidence that would provide their neighbour's motive for killing her husband.

## There's no business...

This play, by Derek Lomas, is about a rehearsal for a play where everyone ends up at each others throats!

## Effie's Burning

Effie's Burning is an extremely powerful two character play by Valerie Windsor. A young doctor finds in the inarticulate but powerful rage of an elderly woman mental patient the key to her own suppressed anger and courage.
