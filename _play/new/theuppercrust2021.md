There have always been those who think to be waited on is their right. Likewise there have always been those whose role it is to serve.

How one side treats the other is a constant source of amazement and interest and in our evening of sketches, playlets, one liners and jokes we attempt to span that divide.

Whether we've served you correctly will be for you to decide!
