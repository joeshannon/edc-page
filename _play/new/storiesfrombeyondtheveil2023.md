### Directed by {{ page.director }}

With a mix of sketches from the spooky to the supernatural, Stories from Beyond
the Veil will attempt to bring the tradition of EDC’s one night stands back from
the dead.

Featuring pieces written by Exeter Drama Company members, come for a glimpse
into worlds not quite like our own, with stories of ghosts, witches, and a whole
lot in between.

On nights for all things scary and spooky, join us for a night of creepiness and
perhaps a couple cautionary tales.
