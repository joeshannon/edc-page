### Written and directed by {{ page.author }}

Edifice And Artifice is an urgent satire on the state of the wealth gap today
and its consequences for the planet.

{% include play/image.html index=0 width=4 height=3 %}

It takes place in the near future at the London headquarters of fictional oil
company Starco, and in the protest camp laying siege to the skyscraper outside.

As London floods and the government retreats and factionalises, victims of the
flooding join those protesting. Meanwhile, the staff left in the building,
including the executives, assume the authorities will step in at any moment.

With this powder keg of expectation, itâ€™s only a matter of time before the haves
and have-nots collide.

{% include play/image.html index=3 width=4 height=3 %}

In the absence of security staff and police, Hector Starholt, heir to the Starco
empire, thinks a TV debate with the protesters will defuse the situation. This
miscalculation rebounds on him with dire consequences.
