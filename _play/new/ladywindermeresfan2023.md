First performed in 1892, Lady Windermere’s Fan was one of Oscar Wilde’s earliest
theatrical successes. The play is centred on the titular character of Lady
Windermere, who on the day of her birthday party hears a disturbing rumour... is
her husband having an affair?

Will the ‘other woman’ really attend the party?

Chronicling a series of misunderstandings and deceptions in the high society
world of Victorian London this hectic upper-class comedy sparkles with Wilde's
trademark wit and intelligence and remains one of his most popular plays to this
day.
