## By Richard Tydeman and Evelyn Cavendish

## Directed by Ian Guy and Pamela Hoad

## 11th - 13th December 2019

## Cornerstone

{% include play/image.html index=0 width=4 height=3 %}

We cover potted, rhyming, versions of Snow White, Cinderella and The Sleeping Beauty

{% include play/image.html index=1 width=4 height=3 %}

We also see how a Prince and Princess rebel against their sickly fairy story wedding.

{% include play/image.html index=2 width=4 height=3 %}

See what mayhem ensues when a certain miserable dwarf runs a dating agency for desperate Princes and check in
on the local assizes where three fairy story villains plead their innocence as they tell their back stories
proving, beyond all doubt, that it really wasn't their fault.

{% include play/image.html index=3 width=3 height=4 %}

Honestly M'Lud!
