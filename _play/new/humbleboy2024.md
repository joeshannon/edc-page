“You know, Felix, bumble bees shouldn’t be able to fly… They don’t obey the laws
of physics. But they fly anyway.”

All is not well in the Humble Hive. Thirty-five-year-old Felix Humble is a
Cambridge astro-physicist in search of a unified field theory.

Following the sudden death of his father, Felix returns to his middle England
home and his difficult and demanding mother, where he soon realizes that his
search for unity must include his own chaotic home life.
