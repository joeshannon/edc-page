{% include play/image_1by2.html index=0 width=4 height=3 %}

Having delved into the theatrical archives we have presented extracts from plays, and reading the poems, of playwrights and authors who don't grace the amateur stage as often as they should.

{% include play/image_1by2.html index=2 width=4 height=3 %}

Comedy, tragedy, foreign languages, sexual intrigue and the interesting (and sometimes racy) biographies of eight very interesting people.

{% include play/image_1by2.html index=4 width=3 height=4 %}

Not only the works of William Shakespeare but also snippets of Christopher Marlowe, Oliver Goldsmith, Aphra Behn, Fanny Burney, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, William Congreve and Harriet Beecher Stowe.
