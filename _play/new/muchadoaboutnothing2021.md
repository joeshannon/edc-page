Returning from the crusades Count Claudio falls in love with Hero the daughter of Leonato, the Governor of Messina.

{% include play/image_1by2.html index=2 width=3 height=4 %}

His friend Benedick continues an ongoing battle of wits and wills with Beatrice, Leonato’s niece while Don John plots mayhem and confusion.

There are accusations, a death, a wedding surprise and the aimless antics of Messina’s night watchmen. What more could you ask for?

With a combination of fresh new faces, old hands and one returning ex member we put our own, very special, slant on Shakespeare with comedy, music, singing, maybe a dance or two and a few hidden extras to keep you entertained!
