Adapted from Kenneth Grahame’s 1908 children’s classic The Wind in the Willows

Toad is a fickle creature constantly searching for his latest muse and fad using
his family wealth to fund his new hobbies.

{% include play/image.html index=2 width=4 height=3 %}

{% include play/image.html index=3 width=16 height=9 %}

Toad’s closest friends Badger, Rat and his newest friend Mole are constantly
trying to keep a reign on Toad in the hope of protecting his dignity and
himself!

Toad is forever headstrong and his latest craze, despite constant pleading from
his friends, may be his downfall.
