## The Trial of Philip Merryfield
### Written and directed by Peter Burnett

A man stands accused of murder on Mars, in the last courtroom of humanity. But was it justified? Philip Merryfield is on trial
for his life, after throwing a member of the crew of the Mars Ark “Bellerophon” out of the airlock just before take-off, and usurping
her place in an attempt to flee a doomed Earth. 
But was he actually right to do so? This short comedy drama follows his trial where the events around the incident are slowly
revealed as Prosecution and Defence battle it out through a stream of witnesses before the Jury (YOU, the audience) pronounce him Guilty or Not Guilty.
