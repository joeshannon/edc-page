Edward Longshanks, Edward I is dead and his weak and ineffectual son is now
Edward II.

{% include play/image_1by2.html index=2 width=4 height=3 %}

His first command is to recall from exile in France his favourite, Piers
Gaveston, an action that proves unwelcome amongst the Barons and the Bishops.

{% include play/image_1by2.html index=4 width=4 height=3 %}

With rebellion brewing, the royal marriage falling apart and the different
factions taking sides armies are raised and the executioner’s axe is wielded
freely.

*Edward II won Best Production in our in-house awards for the 2023/24 season.
Clémence Bernard also won Best Actress for her part as Queen Isabella.*
