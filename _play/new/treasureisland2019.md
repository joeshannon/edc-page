Treasure Island is a buccaneering comedy adventure about treachery, treasure and a young man's rite of passage.

{% include play/image.html index=2 width=3 height=4 %}

The classic tale of Jim Hawkins, Long John Silver and swashbuckling pirates is brought to life by a crew of Exeter Drama Company's salty sea dogs and lasses.

{% include play/image.html index=3 width=4 height=3 %}

Surrounded by elements of wind and water, swords and sea shanties, swept away to the South Seas for a yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.

The treasure hunt of a lifetime!
