The small village of Inishmore is reeling after the death of Wee Thomas, the
beloved cat of Padraic, a violent psychopath deemed too mad to remain a member
of the IRA!

{% include play/image.html index=1 width=4 height=3 %}

He’s away in Northern Ireland for some recreational torturing and bombing of
fish and chip shops when he gets the ‘phone call' and moves heaven and earth to
get back determined to find his cat’s murderer and, naturally, chaos ensues!!

The play, although a black comedy, does not shy away from such topics as
nationalism, violence and terrorism and does contain some ‘spicy’ language.
