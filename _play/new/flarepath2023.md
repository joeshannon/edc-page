At the Falcon Hotel on the Lincolnshire coast, men from a nearby RAF airbase are
planning to spend the weekend with their wives.

Patricia Graham, an actress from London, has something to tell her husband
Teddy, who is a bomber pilot. The situation is complicated when Peter Kyle, a
Hollywood film star, arrives at the hotel, and Teddy is sent out on a night raid
over Germany.

Patricia is torn between a rekindled old flame and loyalty to the husband who
relies on her for support. Tensions rise as a plane goes missing as those at the
hotel sit and wait.
