<p>Appear as countless characters in numerous plays.</p>

<p>Pretend to be someone you’re not, wear unusual or period
clothes, kill rivals, solve crimes or deliver the funniest of
lines without cracking up!</p>

<p>If you can learn your part and not fall off the stage, and
bask in the applause and adoration of a full house then
you’re just what we’re looking for.</p>

<p>Or you could build and paint scenery, do lighting and
sound effects, be part of our stage management team, help
with costumes, be our prompt or simply make the tea.</p>

<p>We’re always looking for people of all abilities and
backgrounds to join us and have fun.</p>

<p>You won’t regret it and you’ll wonder why you
didn’t join us years ago!</p>

<p>Membership is currently £25 per year.</p>
