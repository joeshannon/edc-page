At the moment we don't have a fixed venue so locations will vary on a per production basis.

To see where all our events are taking place see individual events on the [calendar]({% link pages/whatson.html %}).
Tickets can be purchased from the link on the relevant event page or via the yellow ticket button on every page. The ticket prices are currently Â£7 per show.
Add yourself to our mailing list and we will send you out booking forms for all our productions.
