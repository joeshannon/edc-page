From the end of April 2022 we can now be found in Heavitree Church Hall, Church Street, Heavitree, Exeter, EX2 5EH.

Please note that the hall can ONLY be accessed from Church Street. Currently there is no step free access and you will have to come up 12 steps from the entrance on Church Street.
Please note that there is NO way into the hall from the churchyard itself.
There is very limited parking on Church Street but after 6pm the metered parking on Church Lane (behind the hospital) and parts of Heavitree High Street are FREE. There are also two car parks either side of the main road in Heavitree as well.
