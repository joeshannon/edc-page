Following Government advice we are postponing our upcoming production ‘The Camel’s Back’ until further notice.

We have an obligation to follow the guidelines from both H.M. Government and Public Health England.

Theatre, by definition, for both performers and audiences is a close contact environment. Therefore for the safety and precaution of the community all rehearsals and productions will be put on pause until further notice

Please rest assured that the safety of our audiences and all EDC members is our priority. We will keep you updated as plans evolve.

If you have booked tickets for our upcoming production you will be fully refunded: If you purchased via Ticketsource your money will be returned via your payment method. If you bought tickets using our booking form our Publicity Officer will contact you regarding a refund.

Thank you for your patience during this trying time.

Phoebe Guy

*Chair, Exeter Drama Company*
