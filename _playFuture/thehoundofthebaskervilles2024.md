### By {{ page.author }}, adapted from the novel by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
### Directed by {{ page.director }}

The brilliant Sherlock Holmes and his trusted associate Dr John Watson face
their greatest challenge - to investigate the mystery of the giant hound,
apparently on the loose on Dartmoor, that supposedly stalks the Baskerville
family. Along the way, they uncover an ancient family curse that dates over
several generations.

Sir Charles of Baskerville, dies on the moors of his family estate, with a look
of abject fear on his face and the presence of animalâ€™s footprints around his
corpse. As the new heir, Sir Henry Baskerville takes up residence at the estate,
Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson arrive to investigate.
