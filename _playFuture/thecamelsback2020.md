#### By Arnold Helsby, directed by Robin Thwaytes

Mr Hanacott has recently passed on. His will aims to secure the future of his family and ensure his farm is managed efficiently and to this end he insists that his sister, Prudence, should bring her business acumen to the farm.

However, running a farm is rather different from running a successful draper's shop and her methods are not always welcomed by the family, the farm staff or the villagers.

A production of an amateur play leads to problems on the farm - including some sexual frissons and plotting to drive the interfering Aunt away!
