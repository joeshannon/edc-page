Vanity Fair chronicles the intertwined lives of two contrasting young women, the
ambitious but morally flexible Becky Sharp and the naïve and kind Amelia Sedley,
as they navigate British Society and the backdrop of the Napoleonic Wars.

The story follows Becky's determined efforts to rise in social status and
financial security through wit, charm, and a lot of cunning, contrasted with
Amelia's more sheltered and conventional path and things don’t always turn out
the way they were meant to!
