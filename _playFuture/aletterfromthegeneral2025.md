It is 1950 and revolution has swept a far eastern country and now reached a
mission station which cares for children.

A new, Communist, government is now in place and is persecuting religious orders
throughout the province.

The mission is cut off from the local village and the orphaned children have
been removed.

The British Consul, together with his wife Ruth, visit the mission and work with
the nuns to secure their safe passage out before the General and his army
arrive.
