### Porcelain and Pink
#### By F. Scott Fitzgerald
#### Directed by Elizabeth Harding

Porcelain and Pink is a witty case of mistaken identity where the main character
spends the entire time in a bathtub.

### The Real Inspector Hound
#### By Tom Stoppard
#### Directed by Jack Harding

The Real Inspector Hound is a mad-cap, whodunnit play-within-a-play which
promises laughter, three murders, and twists and turns galore.
