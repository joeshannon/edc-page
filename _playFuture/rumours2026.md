### A farce by {{ page.author }}
### Directed by {{ page.director }}

Ken and Chris have found their host, Charley, a prominent Government official,
in his bedroom, too dazed to speak, with a bullet wound in his ear lobe after an
apparent suicide attempt!

Len and Claire arrive, themselves injured in a car crash, and are soon joined by
Ernest and Cookie, Glenn and Cassie, each with their own problems.

Can they keep a lid on what has happened or are the police going to find out?
