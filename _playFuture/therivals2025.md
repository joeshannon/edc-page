Wealthy heiress Lydia Languish is determined to marry for love even if this
means she is forced into poverty.

{% include play/image_1by2.html index=2 width=4 height=3 %}

Realising this, the aristocratic Captain Jack Absolute woos her while claiming
to be Ensign Beverley.

{% include play/image.html index=4 width=3 height=4 %}

Lydia’s aunt, Mrs. Malaprop, will not permit her to wed a mere ensign and
proposes another gentleman, Squire Acres.

Jack’s Father, Sir Anthony Absolute, arrives unexpectedly and tells his son that
he’s chosen a wife for him whilst Sir Lucius O’Trigger continues his efforts to
win over the mysterious Delia.
