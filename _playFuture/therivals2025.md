Wealthy heiress Lydia Languish is determined to marry for love even if this
means she is forced into poverty.

Realising this, the aristocratic Captain Jack Absolute woos her while claiming
to be Ensign Beverley.

Lydia’s aunt, Mrs. Malaprop, will not permit her to wed a mere ensign and
proposes another gentleman, Squire Acres.

Jack’s Father, Sir Anthony Absolute, arrives unexpectedly and tells his son that
he’s chosen a wife for him whilst Sir Lucius O’Trigger continues his efforts to
win over the mysterious Delia.
