#### Directed by Ian Guy and Alice Purcell

Returning from the crusades Count Claudio falls in love with Hero the daughter of Leonato, the Governor of Messina. 

His friend Benedick continues an ongoing battle of wits and wills with Beatrice, Leonato’s niece while Don John plots mayhem and confusion. 

There are accusations, a death, a wedding surprise and the aimless antics of Messina’s night watchmen. What more could you ask for?

With a combination of fresh new faces, old hands and one returning ex member we put our own, very special, slant on Shakespeare with comedy, music, singing, maybe a dance or two and a few hidden extras to keep you entertained!
