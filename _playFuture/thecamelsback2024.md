Mr Hannacott, the owner of a farm, has recently died. His will aims to secure the future of his family and ensure the farm is managed efficiently. To this end he insists that his sister Prudence, a spinster, should bring her business acumen to the farm.

However, running a farm is very different to running a successful draper's shop, and her methods are not always welcomed by the family, the farm staff or the villagers.

A production of an amateur play in the village leads to problems on the farm as well as the farmâ€™s residents grapple with how to get rid of Prudence!
